		    <h2>A little About Me</h2>
		    <br>
		    <div id="about_text">
			    <p>Hi, my name is Savill Khemraj and I am a 19 year old pursuing a degree in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I currently attend the University of Guelph and have completed 2 years thus far. As a student, I am still constantly learning new things, and have a real interest in learning more. I feel as though my work ethic, motivation, and ability to pick up things quickly is what sets me apart from others.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    I was first exposed to the world of computer science in a grade 10 class in high school when I was fifteen. After taking that class, I knew I found something I could do for the rest of my life. I didn't code again until I entered university, but I began learning things at a quick rate, and concepts became very clear. And now, two years later, I can confidently say that although I may have less experience than some of my peers, I am now at the very least on par with people with four to six years of experience.

		    <h2>Languages</h2>
		    <br>
		    <div id="languages_text">
			    <p>
			    	The language that I am most familiar with is <b><u>C</u></b>. Now I understand that most modern software doesn't really involve C, however, I believe that learning C was very beneficial because of how low level it is. It has given me a deeper understand of why things are the way they are, and it also made me a better programmer because of the fact that C doesn't hold your hand. I learned how to manage memory and pointers, and due to the little support C provides, I am able to complete tasks without the need for extended libraries or built in features.
			    	<br>
			    	<br>
		            Next to C, the language I am the most familiar with is <b><u>Java</u></b>. I completed a university course covering this language, and feel that my knowledge in C was incredibly useful when it came to learning Java. I also have a little experince with <b><u>JavaScript</u></b>, <b><u>jQuery</u></b>, <b><u>HTML</u></b>, <b><u>CSS</u></b>, and <b><u>MySQL</u></b>. While practicing with these languages, I integrated C code with Javascript code, used HTML, CSS and jQuery for the GUI, and utilized MySQL to save the data needed for the dynamic webpage.
		            <br>
		            <br>
		            I have experience with <b><u>Unix/Linux</u></b>, and <b><u>MacOS</u></b>, as these are the Operating systems I use the most. I am also familiar with <b><u>Windows</u></b>, but as I use a mac now, my strength is with Apple's OS.
